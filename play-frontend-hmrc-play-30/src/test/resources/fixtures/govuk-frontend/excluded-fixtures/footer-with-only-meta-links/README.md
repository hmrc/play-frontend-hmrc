This fixture is excluded because we have decided not to implement the functionality from `govuk-frontend` to override the content licence using the property `contentLicence: null`.

This decision was made during the upgrade to `govuk-frontend` v5.14.0. At the time of writing, we don't think there is a use case for this for HMRD MDTP services.
